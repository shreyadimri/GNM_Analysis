In all three manipulated groups, they have control and aromatic plants added. This is courtship hypothesis experiment where females are the one adding the green nest material (manipulated by the researchers in this case). ""Authors say: “In blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus, females alone build nests and add aromatic plants to them.” and “We hypothesized that if nest size and aromatic plants in the nest are female sexually selected signals (Moreno et al. 1994; Soler, M.ller, et al. 1998; Moreno 2012), males should vary their parental investment accordingly, as the differential allocation hypothesis predicts (Burley 1986; Sheldon 2000).
